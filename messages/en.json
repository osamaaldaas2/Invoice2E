    "faqSubtitle": "Everything you need to know about Invoice2E",
    "faq1Q": "Is the AI-extracted data accurate?",
    "faq1A": "Our AI achieves 95%+ accuracy on average. You always review and edit the extracted data before final conversion, ensuring 100% accuracy. The system highlights low-confidence fields for your attention.",
    "faq2Q": "What if I need to make changes after extraction?",
    "faq2A": "Every invoice goes through a review screen where you can edit any field (seller/buyer details, line items, totals, tax rates). You have full control before generating the final XRechnung XML.",
    "faq3Q": "Is the generated XRechnung legally compliant?",
    "faq3A": "Yes. Every invoice is validated against EN 16931 (European standard) and XRechnung 3.0.2 (German implementation) using the official KoSIT validator. We check over 200 business rules before allowing download.",
    "faq4Q": "How secure is my data?",
    "faq4A": "We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS, encrypted database storage). Your invoice data is processed securely and deleted after 90 days. We never share your data with third parties.",
    "faq5Q": "Can I process multiple invoices at once?",
    "faq5A": "Yes! Upload a ZIP file with up to 100 invoices via our bulk upload feature. Review each invoice individually or save all at once. Download all XRechnung files as a single ZIP.",
    "faq6Q": "What happens if the conversion fails?",
    "faq6A": "If the AI extraction fails or the invoice doesn't pass validation, you'll see detailed error messages. You can edit the data to fix issues, and we only charge credits for successful conversions. Failed extractions are free.",

    "step1Desc": "Advanced vision models process your invoice document and extract all structured data fields required for electronic invoicing.",
    "step1Details": "The AI scans the entire document including headers, line items table, totals section, and footer. It identifies over 50 data points: seller/buyer information (BT-27 to BT-63), invoice metadata (BT-1, BT-2, BT-3), line items with quantities and prices (BT-126 to BT-131), tax breakdowns (BT-106 to BT-117), payment instructions (BT-81 to BT-84), and electronic routing addresses (BT-34, BT-49). Special attention is paid to European VAT IDs, IBANs, and multi-currency amounts.",
    "step1Example": "Extracted fields: invoiceNumber='RE-2024-0042', invoiceDate='2024-01-15', sellerVatId='DE123456789', buyerName='Acme GmbH', lineItems=[{desc:'Consulting', qty:8, unitPrice:125.00, taxRate:19}], subtotal=1000.00, taxAmount=190.00, totalAmount=1190.00, currency='EUR'",
    "step2Title": "EN 16931 Semantic Validation",
    "step2Desc": "Extracted data is validated against 150+ business rules defined in the European standard EN 16931-1:2017, ensuring semantic correctness and business logic integrity.",
    "step2Details": "The validator enforces cardinality rules (mandatory vs optional fields), data type constraints (dates in ISO 8601, amounts with 2-4 decimals, country codes in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), code list validation (currency ISO 4217, tax category codes S/Z/E/AE/K/G), and cross-field business rules. Key checks include: BR-CO-15 (sum of line net amounts + allowances/charges = invoice net), BR-CO-16 (VAT category tax amount = VAT category taxable amount × rate), BR-1 through BR-65 (core semantic rules), and BR-CL-* (code list conformance).",
    "step2Example": "Validated rules: BR-CO-15 ✓ (1000.00 + 0 = 1000.00), BR-16 ✓ (invoice total present), BR-S-08 ✓ (seller VAT when tax S/AE/K/G), BR-CO-9 ✓ (line net = qty × price), BR-DEC-01 ✓ (amounts max 2 decimals), BR-CL-01 ✓ (currency=EUR in ISO 4217 list)",
    "step3Title": "XRechnung XML Generation",
    "step3Desc": "Validated data is transformed into XRechnung 3.0.2 XML format (UBL 2.1 or UN/CEFACT CII 16B syntax), mapping all business terms and applying German extension rules (BR-DE-*).",
    "step3Details": "The generator creates a syntactically correct XML document following XRechnung specification profiles. All 200+ business terms (BT-1 to BT-151) are mapped to their corresponding XML paths. German extensions are applied: BR-DE-1 to BR-DE-29 (mandatory fields like seller phone, buyer country code, payment terms text), Leitweg-ID routing (BT-34-1), and IBAN validation (BR-DE-23-a). The XML structure includes cac:AccountingSupplierParty, cac:AccountingCustomerParty, cac:InvoiceLine elements with proper namespaces (urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-2, urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017).",

    "step4Title": "KoSIT Official Validation",
    "step4Desc": "The final XML document is validated using the official KoSIT Validator 1.6.1 with XRechnung 3.0.2 scenarios, performing Schematron rule checks, XSD grammar validation, and technical syntax verification.",
    "step4Details": "The KoSIT validator runs three validation layers: (1) XSD schema validation ensures well-formed XML with correct namespaces and element structure, (2) Schematron rules (180+ assertions) verify business semantics including BR-S-02 (seller VAT required for standard-rated invoices), BR-S-04 (buyer VAT required for reverse charge), BR-S-08 (payment means code validation), and BR-DE-* German-specific rules, (3) Code list validation checks values against official code lists (ISO, CEF, UNTDID). The validator outputs a detailed report with acceptance status (valid/invalid), error location XPath, and rule violation descriptions.",
    "step4Example": "Validation report: acceptanceStatus='VALID', schematronErrors=0, xsdErrors=0. Checked rules: BR-S-02 ✓, BR-S-08 ✓, BR-DE-1 ✓ (seller.address.street present), BR-DE-6 ✓ (seller.phone present), BR-DE-15 ✓ (payment terms present), BR-DE-23-a ✓ (IBAN format DE89370400440532013000)",
